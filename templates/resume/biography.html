        <p>
            Born in Ramsar and raised in Karaj, I graduated from Sharif University of Technology and am now
            transitioning
            to the field of Information Technology for my master's degree. During my formative years as a university
            student, I developed a profound passion for Python and the art of coding. The act of creating applications
            feels akin to breathing life into inanimate constructsâ€”a testament to the boundless potential of human
            ingenuity.

            Post-graduation, my intellectual pursuits have expanded to encompass a diverse array of fields, including
            machine learning, backend development, network security, cryptography, blockchain, and even the emerging
            realm of quantum computing. I am driven by an insatiable curiosity to continuously broaden the horizons
            of my knowledge.
